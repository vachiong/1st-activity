                <p>Learning is not a destination. It is a continuous process. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse tincidunt mattis commodo. Etiam vel </p>

                <div class="inner">
                  <p>I'm Rubby, 21 years of age. I came all the way from Eastern Samar and currently staying here in Cebu City to pursue my dreams. I'm a scholar of Passerelles Numeriques and a 2nd Year student in Computer Technology.  </p>
                    
                  <p>I am an introverted person. I don't speak always but I'm good at listening. One of my strengths is being a fast learner. Since I'm not good at memorizing, I have  made an effort to become a critical thinker and be good at analyzation.
                      I have dreamed to become an Accountant before but as what they say, people change. When opporunity to become an IT professional came to me, I did not hesitate to grab it. So now, I am doing my
                      best to acquire the best skills that I can get to become an IT Professional in the future. Through my journey, I have learned different programming languages like Javascript, Java, Python, SQL and also markup languages which are HTML and CSS.
                  </p>                    
                  <p>When you don't see  me coding, you can find me in my room reading fiction books with a cup of black coffee on the side.</p>

                    <h3>Learning New Skills</h3>
                    <p>Since I was a child I have always been facinated by the things that surround. I'm always curious about how things works. Whenever I discover 
                      something interesting, I try it. Just like the day when I watched a tiktok video showing the process of drawing charcoal portrait.
                      I became interested with drawing after I saw that video and now I do commission drawing for other people.

                    <h3>Reading</h3>
                   <p> I like to be alone with myself. As a result, I found a new thing to do while I am enjoying my own company. Aside from gaining new vocabs while reading, It also gives me
                    enjoyment by different fiction world. I sometimes forgot my problems when I immersed my self into reading.

                    <h3>Business</h3>
                    <p>I am from a poor family and our income is only enough for our daily food. We cannot afford to buy our personal needs everytime we need it.
                      That's when I became a business minded person. I think of ideas on how I am going to make an extra income in order for me to buy my needs. Just like these days,
                      I accept portrait commissions from other people where they pay me to draw them.
