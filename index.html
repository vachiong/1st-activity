        <h1>Bebie Grace Balbuena</h1>
        <p>My ultimate goal was to finish college, that way there’s a big possibility that I could find
        many opportunities to find a great job. And when that happens, everything will be easier for me
        then I will be able to help my family and other people who need my help.</p>
        <p>from all
        those things I had experienced, I’ve realized that “when you are in a worst situation, don’t think
        that you are hopeless but rather believe that there are always ways that will turn you into a new
        leaf which you never expected”.</p>
