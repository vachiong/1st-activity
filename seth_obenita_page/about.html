                I know it sounds a little bit silly but I'm really passionate about learning new things. I got curious easily to the things that is new to me. Curiosity helps me to signals a hungry mind. Im inquisitive, to open  new experiences. With that I can generate more original ideas and produce simple solutions to complex problems. More over it serves as a motivational tool for me. <br> <br> For me learning something new you makes  exercising my brain, which can help improve cognitive functions such as concentration, attention to detail, memory recall and problem solving. And according to my research learning new skills can makes us achieve our goals and boosts our self confidence. 
                On the other hand my unbreakable interests are watching satisfying videos like mukbang and watching my babies on internet. <br><br> I love watching kpop artists to be specific the Bangtan Seonyondan aka BTS. They are one of my inspiration in life why I am still fighting with my dreams. <br> <br> In sports I have interest in Volleyball, chess and table tennis. <br> I can dance different genre too. <br><br> And lastly as I said earlier the highlight of my interest is adventure. To travel different places  and my favorite destination it to go to Deagu, Incheon and Busan South Korea. 
               <br><br> Another reason why I love to travel, it helps open my mind and realize that there's no one way to live life. Meeting people from other places will show you that your world view isn't the same as everyone else's. You can't imagine how different life is in another place until you see for yourself. <br> <br> So for me Traveling is an interest, an hobby, a passion, a work, a goal, a meaning for life and much more.
                Setting goals are very important in life, the main purpose is to outline a set of objectives and by which means you will be able to achieve them. And that is to achieve all my dreams in life, to make my parents proud and lastly my goals are to also have happiness, prosperity in every area in my life, and the freedom and peace within to be able to carry out my goals. </i> </b>
